      Title: Tatanka Complex - Buffalo fire (Final-"Version#2"), located about 15 miles southeast of Gardiner, MT. This assessment was completed with a post fire EO-1 ALI image which had some minor issues with geometric rectification. The prefire Landsat scene and ALI image had a small amount of scene to scene misrectification which could increase misclassification of burn severity. The postfire scene was also acquired late in the season on 10/12/2016 which increased the impact of terrain shadows. This assessment did capture considerable burned acreage that was not included in the previously delivered preliminary version.

  Description:
    Abstract:  The pre-fire and post-fire subsets included were used to create a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The dNBR image attempts to portray the variation of burn severity within a fire. The severity ratings are influenced by the effects to the canopy.  The severity rating is based upon a composite of the severity to the understory (grass, shrub layers), midstory trees and overstory trees. Because there is often a strong correlation between canopy consumption and soil effects, this algorithm works in many cases for BAER teams whose objective is a soil burn severity assessment.  It is not, however, accurate in all ecosystems or fires.

    Purpose: These data were created by USGS EROS to support Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams.

        buffalov2_pre754_20150919-patch20150911_l8.img = Pre-Fire Landsat scene. A few small cloud/shadow areas were patched with a similar Landsat 7 scene.

        buffalov2_barc256_20161012-20150919_20150911_clip1box.img = 256-class (0-255) continuous image representing fire severity. This dataset is meant to be adjusted if thevBARC4 does not provide a good estimate of fire severity. It is anticipated that users will adjust the breakpoints between classes, then recode to their desired 3 or 4 classes.

	buffalov2_barc4_20161012-20150919_20150911_clip1box.img = Four category severity classification subset in ERDAS Imagine format with values:

      Process_Description:

        These data products are derived from EO-1 ALI post fire and Landsat 7/8 pre-fire data. Pre-fire and post-fire scenes are analyzed to create a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The dNBR image portrays the variation of burn severity within the fire. The pre- and post-fire images are terrain corrected and Landsat scenes are corrected to Top of Atmosphere reflectance. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is computed for each date of imagery using ALI bands 10 (SWIR) and 6 (NIR) and using Landsat bands 7 (SWIR) and 5 (NIR). 
When using pre and postfire Landsat 8 scenes the formula below is used: 
        (Band 5(NIR) - Band 7(SWIR) / (Band 5 + Band 7) = NBR

        The Differenced NBR is computed to determine severity by subtracting the post-fire NBR from the pre-fire NBR:
        (PreNBR - PostNBR) = dNBR

        The BARC products are a generalization of the raw dNBR dataset. Both BARC products have been resampled to unsigned 8-bit images and are easily viewed and adjusted within ArcGIS.

        The classes represented on the BARC products are created with thresholds chosen by an analyst at USGS EROS.  These thresholds can be roughly related back to original dNBR values by multiplying by 5 and then subtracting 275 (for example, a BARC256 value of 100 would relate to a dNBR value of 225).  The thresholds used on this particular fire are:

   
	Unchanged:	All values   0 - 68
	Low:		All values  69 - 102
	Moderate:	All values 103 - 180
	High:		All values 181 - 255
	No Data/Clouds:	All values 

 
 
        General descriptions of the severity classes are below:

	Unchanged:  	This means the area after the fire was indistinguishable from pre-fire conditions. 
			This does not always indicate the area did not burn.
	Low: 		This severity class represents areas of surface fire with little change in cover and little
			mortality of the dominant vegetation.
	Moderate: 	This severity class is between low and high and means there is a mixture of effects on the
			dominant vegetation.
	High: 		This severity class represents areas where the canopy has high to complete consumption.
